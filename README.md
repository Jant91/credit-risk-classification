# credit-risk-classification

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict credit risk using historical lending data. The goal is to classify borrowers as either 'healthy' or 'high-risk'.

## Files
- `credit_risk_classification.ipynb`: Contains the analysis and model-building code.
- `lending_data.csv`: Dataset of historical lending activity.

## Process
- Data is loaded and split into features and target (loan status).
- A logistic regression model is trained and tested.
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Data imbalance is addressed through oversampling.

## Results
- The model's effectiveness in predicting credit risk is assessed.
- Key metrics: accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Conclusion
Summary of findings and recommendations based on the model's performance.
